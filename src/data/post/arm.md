Our new 6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm is designed for high performance and reliability. Built using a sandwich structure of 3D-printed parts and metal reinforcements, it combines low weight with excellent strength and rigidity.

## Structure

The arm’s 3D-printed shells allow complex geometries and reduce mass, while metal inserts strengthen load-bearing areas. This hybrid design achieves the perfect balance between durability and manufacturability.

## Actuation

Each joint uses a cycloidal gear drive, offering high torque, zero backlash, and smooth motion. This setup efficiently converts motor rotation into precise, amplified torque — ideal for stable operation even under varying loads.

## Performance

With six rotational joints, the arm provides human-like motion and fine control. Its compact, modular design ensures easy integration on the rover and straightforward maintenance.

## In Summary

By combining 3D printing, metal reinforcement, and cycloidal gear actuation, we’ve created a lightweight yet powerful 6-DOF arm — built for precision, strength, and reliable exploration.
